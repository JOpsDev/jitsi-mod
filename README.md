# jitsi-mod

This small app should help to include single Jitsi Meet participants 
into a streaming setup e.g. by including a browser source in OBS Studio.

It is based on the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/jurcello/jitsi-vue-tutorial)
for the excellent [Jitsi-Vue.js tutorial](https://www.thecodingartist.com/blogs/creating-custom-jitsi-ui-using-vuejs/) 
by Jur de Vries.
